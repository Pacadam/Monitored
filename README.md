FNAF-like game loop
Multiple nights/shifts (M-OU une longue nuit en intervalle ex: 9pm-10pm, 10pm-11pm qui deviennent de plus en plus dure)(V-Connais pas The Pitt, mais des levels basés sur l’heure est bien aussi))
Unknown entities will walk around the oil rig, preying
Player will have to check systems, monster locations, to try to survive a mysterious wrath

## Suggestions - [GAMEPLAY] / [LORE]
- Location: Operating in international waters on an offshore petroleum platform [LORE](V-MGSV vibes, I like it!)
- Big-ahh evil corporation, disregard for safety measures, you are not the first and won't be the last on this night shift… [LORE]
- A pissed off outer force (Divine echo) has taken upon itself to delay the inevitable, and it is your turn to suffer its wrath. [LORE]
- Le jeu ce joue du point de vue de l’affichage du système de sécurité, avec possibilité de 3D plus tard [GAMEPLAY]
- Chaque monstre est une invocation de l’ange, représentant un scénario de fin de monde moderne plausible. Le joueur ne sait pas. [LORE]
- Fire alarms, power management, lighting, machine control (noise and functionality), motion sensor, why is there so much security on this platform?… [GAMEPLAY]
- 64-bit display for efficient readings (et moins dure à coder…) (V-...oh?)[GAMEPLAY]
- Intro cinematic ? [GAMEPLAY](V-Yes!) (O- oh no ) 
- The platform is for extraction only, and is NOT a containment. The “creature problem” is known by executives, but overlooked. [LORE](V-What is the inevitable they are trying to stop? Could’ve had containers with creatures inside, for some reason, explained in a manifest log)
- Dawn/Dusk event, with specific monsters with times? (O- Sur un oil rig Dawn/Dusk [Storm] ? )[GAMEPLAY]
